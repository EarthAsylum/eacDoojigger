purchased the same level of support.

= 6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMERS =

1.	__Limited Warranty__. ​Licensor warrants that, for a period of
(30) days from the [original delivery date], the Software will be reasonably free
from defects in materials and workmanship and substantially conform to the
specifications set forth in the Documentation. All specifications are provided
based on testing of the Software in a laboratory setting, and actual performance
may be affected by network connections, software and hardware configuration and
hardware specifications. This limited warranty does not apply to third-party
open source software.

2.	__Exclusive Remedy__. Licensor’s entire liability and Customer’s exclusive
remedy in case of a breach of the foregoing limited warranty shall be correction
of the error or, at Licensor’s sole option, replacement of the Software.

3.	__Exclusion of Warranty__. This limited warranty is void if the defect has
resulted from accident, abuse, negligence, misapplication, or where the Software
has not been properly installed or used in accordance with the Documentation.

4.	__Disclaimer__. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, THE
SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE
OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE FAIL SAFE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR THAT THE
SOFTWARE WILL PROTECT AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE THREATS. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
NON-INTERFERENCE, AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT.

5.	__Exceptions__. Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
expressed or implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to
Customer. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN
DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD (OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW).

= 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY =

IN NO EVENT, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL LICENSOR OR ITS
LICENSORS, PARTNERS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTIES

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR EXPENSE, (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, DAMAGE TO NETWORKS, EQUIPMENT, OR HARDWARE, OR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT
OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR TECHNOLOGY). Regardless of whether the claim for such
damages is based in contract, tort, or any other legal theory, in no event
shall Licensor’s aggregate liability to Customer for direct damages exceed the
original purchase price of the Software, Support Services or other amounts paid
by Customer, even if Licensor has been advised of such damages. The foregoing
limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law​. THE
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT END USERS USE THEIR
COMPUTERS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY CUSTOMER CAN IMPLEMENT
BACK-UP PLANS AND SAFEGUARDS APPROPRIATE TO CUSTOMER’S NEEDS IN THE ENTENT AN
ERROR IN THE SOFTWARE CAUSES COMPUTER PROBLEMS AND RELATED DATA LOSSES. FOR

or agent who has a need to know same, or who is bound by a non-disclosure and
confidentiality provision at least as restrictive as those set forth in this
Agreement. Each party agrees to ensure that its employees, agents,
representatives, and contractors are advised of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information and are precluded from taking any action prohibited
under this Agreement. ​Licensor may use any technical information that Customer
provides to Licensor for any of Licensor’s reasonable business purposes,
including product support and development.

3.	__Ownership of Information__. Except as explicitly stated in this
Agreement, the party receiving the Confidential Information is granted no
license or conveyance of disclosing party’s Confidential Information or any
intellectual property rights therein. Title to the disclosing party’s
Confidential Information shall remain solely with the party disclosing the
Confidential Information.

4.	__Remedies__. It is further understood and agreed that money damages may
not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of the confidentiality provisions of
this Agreement and that either party may be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach.
Such remedies may not be deemed exclusive remedies for a breach of these
provisions but may be deemed in addition to all other remedies available at law
or in equity.

communications about the Software, including special offers and pricing or other
similar information, customer surveys or other requests for feedback
("Communications"). Licensor will send Communications via in-product notices or

impact on Customer’s use of the Software and the provision of any Support
Services). Licensor reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to
revise, supplement, and otherwise modify this Agreement and to impose new or
additional rules, policies, terms or conditions (collectively, "Additional
Terms") on Customer’s use of the Software. Such Additional Terms will be

terminated by either party. Licensor may terminate this Agreement and the
licenses granted hereunder, upon written notice for any material breach of this

Software infringes or violates any United States patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, or other proprietary rights of a third-party. Customer may, at its own
expense, assist in such defense if it so desires, provided that Licensor shall
control such defense and all negotiations relating to the settlement of any such
claim. Customer shall promptly provide Licensor with written notice of any claim
which Customer believes falls within the scope of this indemnification provision
of the Agreement. In the event that the Software or any portion thereof is held
to constitute an infringement and its use is enjoined, Licensor may, at its sole
option and expense, (i) modify the infringing Software so that it is
non-infringing, (ii) procure for Customer the right to continue to use the
infringing Software, or (iii) replace said Software with suitable,
non-infringing software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor will have no
obligation for any claims to the extent such claims result from (i)
modifications or alterations of the Software made by or for Customer or any
other party that were not provided by Licensor or authorized by Licensor in
writing; (ii) use outside the scope of the license granted hereunder, (iii) use
of a superseded or previous version of the Software if infringement would have
been avoided by the use of a newer version which Licensor made available to
Customer, or (iv) use of the Software in combination with any other software,
hardware or products not supplied by Licensor. This indemnity obligation is
subject to the limitation of liability and does not apply to any open source
components of the Software.
