#### Summary

{EarthAsylum Consulting} **{eac}Doojigger** is a multi functional and highly extensible WordPress plugin that eases and advances WordPress development and includes several 'Doolollys' (extensions) providing file access, security, debugging, encryption, session management, maintenance mode, administration tools, and more.

*{eac}Doojigger* is not only a fully functional plugin, but more so, an architectural development platform (using shared/abstract code) enabling the effortless creation of full featured...

1.  [Custom 'Doojiggers' (Plugins derived from {eac}Doojigger)](#custom-derivative-plugins).
    +   Create your own plugin with {eac}Doojigger as a robust, efficient, and clean foundation.

2.  [Custom 'Doolollys' (Doojigger Extensions)](#custom-eacdoojigger-extensions).
    +   Add easy-to-code, task-oriented extensions installed or included in the "Extensions" folder of your 'Doojigger' plugin or WordPress theme.

3.  [Custom 'Doohickeys' (Doololly Plugins)](#custom-extension-plugins).
    +   Load your plugin extensions ('Doolollys') as their own WordPress plugins with their own installation folder.

Rather than updating or customizing themes and functions, it is often best to isolate your custom code in a plugin ('Doojigger') or extension ('Doololly') so that code is not lost when the theme is changed or updated. Themes should only be used and customized with code pertinent to the look and feel of your site. Any code that should be retained after changing a theme belongs in a 'Doojigger' or 'Doololly'. This keeps your code reusable and theme independent.

_{eac}Doojigger makes purpose-driven, task-oriented, theme-independent, reliable, and efficient code easy to create and maintain._

#### 'Doojiggers' - Custom Derivative Plugins

Once {eac}Doojigger is installed and registered, you, the developer, can create your own plugin using the abstract classes and traits provided.

+   First, create a simple plugin loader using your plugin class name (myAwesomePlugin.php).
    This is the primary plugin file and must contain the required WordPress headers; it will use the plugin_loader trait provided by {eac}Doojigger.
+   Second, create your actual plugin class (myAwesomePlugin.class.php) that gets loaded by your plugin loader.
    This class extends the {eac}Doojigger abstract classes (abstract_context, abstract_frontend, abstract_backend)
    which include all of the management and utility code needed for a full-featured, full-functioning plugin.
+   Third, upload and install your plugin.


Your plugin code need only focus on your particular requirements. The WordPress code and many utility functions have been taken care of for you.

>   See detailed [instructions and examples](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/derivatives/) (found in the *[Extras]/Plugins/* folder).


#### 'Doolollys' - Custom Doojigger Extensions

An extension is a PHP program class that adds functionality to the base plugin. Extensions can be coded for specific needs and can be as simple or complex as needed.

+   First, create an extension class (myAwesomeExtension.extension.php) that extends the extension abstract class (abstract_extension).
+   Second, upload your extension to the plugin's 'Extensions' folder.

*Custom extensions may also be uploaded to your theme folder (preferable a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)), in the ../eacDoojigger/Extensions folder.*

>   See detailed [instructions and examples](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/extensions/) (found in the *[Extras]/Extensions/* folder).


#### 'Doohickeys' - Custom Extension Plugins

Since uploading extensions to the plugin or theme folder risks overwriting those extensions when upgrading or re-installing the plugin or theme, it is very easy to add extensions as their own WordPress plugin. The plugin simply answers a filter from the base plugin telling it where to load additional extensions. These extensions then exist in their own plugin folder with no risk of being overwritten.


#### Using {eac}Doojigger

{eac}Doojigger provides many useful methods and hooks which can be accessed from your custom plugins or extensions, as well as from your theme functions or any code in WordPress.

>   See:
>	+ [Using {eac}Doojigger](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/using-doojigger) (found in the *[Extras]/UsingDoojigger/* folder) for details and examples,
>   + [{eac}Doojigger PHP Reference](https://earthasylum.github.io/docs.eacDoojigger/) documentation.


#### Automatic Updates

WordPress hosted plugins provide updating functionality automatically. Whenever a new version of a plugin is updated in the WordPress repository, update notifications are seen in your WordPress dashbord on the plugins page.

You can provide the same functionality with your externally or self hosted plugin with a few easy changes.

>   See [Automatic Updates](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/automatic-updates/) (found in the *[Extras]/AutoUpdate/* folder) for more information.

#### Contextual Help

To complete your plugin and improve support, provide contextual help using the {eac}Doojigger interface to standard WordPress help functions.

Adding contextual help to your plugin and extension is easy using the methods built into {eac}Doojigger... and when using the proper filter, you can ensure that your help content only shows on your plugin page or extension tab.

>   See the [Contextual Help](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/contextual-help/) page (found in the *[Extras]/ContextualHelp/* folder) for complete details and examples.

[Extras]:	https://github.com/EarthAsylum/docs.eacDoojigger/tree/main/Extras


#### Advanced Mode

Advanced Mode gives developers a method to implement options or features based on an advanced mode setting (or combination of settings). {eac}Doojigger uses a menu selection and license level to enable advanced mode, but custom derivatives may use other methods to implement advanced mode.
>   See [Implementing and Using Advanced Mode](https://eacdoojigger.earthasylum.com/how-to/#implementing-and-using-advanced-mode) for details.


### Multi-Site Network

>   A multisite network is a collection of sites that all share the same WordPress installation core files. They can also share plugins and themes. The individual sites in the network are virtual sites in the sense that they do not have their own directories on your server, although they do have separate directories for media uploads within the shared installation, and they do have separate tables in the database.

{eac}Doojigger is well aware of multi-site/network environments where only a network administrator may install plugins and plugins may be *network-activated* (enabled for all sites) or *site-activated* (enabled for/by individual sites within the network).

{eac}Doojigger manages installation, activation, deactivation and un-installing properly based on the type of installation and activation. For example, when an {eac}Doojigger derivative plugin is *network-activated*, it is activated on all sites in the network. When un-installed, it is un-installed from all sites. When installed by the network administrator but not *network activated*, each site administrator may properly activate or de-activate the plugin.

{eac}Doojigger also manages options and transients on network installations differently than the WordPress defaults...

{eac}Doojigger makes a distinction between *network installed* (i.e. a plugin *installed* on a multisite network) and *network activated* (i.e. *activated* on all sites in a multisite network).

The WordPress `+_network_option()` (e.g. `get_network_option()`) and `+_site_option()` (e.g. `get_site_option()`) methods are essentially the same and fallback to `+_option()` methods (e.g. single-site `get_option()`) if not installed  on a multisite network. As well, `+_site_transient()` methods fallback to `+_transient()` when not on a multisite network.

WordPress does not check (nor should it) for the type of plugin *activation* (network wide vs. individual site).

{eac}Doojigger methods are different...

+   `$this->+_network_option()` (`$this->get_network_option()`) methods only work on a multi-site installation when the plugin was *network activated* and do nothing (return default value) on a single-site activation.
+   `$this->+_site_option()` methods only use network methods if the plugin was *network activated* on a multi-site installation, otherwise these methods fallback to `+_option()` (single-site) methods.
+   `$this->+_site_transient()` methods only use network methods if the plugin was *network activated* or if invoked by the *network administrator*, otherwise these methods fallback to `+_transient()` (single-site) methods.

These are important differences and help make managing options and transients more effective in a network environment.

To illustrate these differences, if we run this code:

    \add_option('my_test_option','my test');
    \add_network_option(null,'my_test_option','my network test');

    $this->add_option('my_test_option','my test');
    $this->add_network_option('my_test_option','my network test');

We get this...

| 'get' option                  | Single site installation  | Site activated        | Network activated |
| ---                           | ---                       | ---                   | --- |
| `get_option()`                | 'my network test'         | 'my test'             | 'my test' |
| `get_network_option()`        | 'my network test'         | 'my network test'     | 'my network test' |
| `get_site_option()`           | 'my network test'         | 'my network test'     | 'my network test' |
| `$this->get_option()`         | 'my test'                 | 'my test'             | 'my test' |
| `$this->get_network_option()` | false                     | false                 | 'my network test' |
| `$this->get_site_option()`    | 'my test'                 | 'my test'             | 'my network test' |

Add this code:

    \add_site_option('my_test_option','my site test');
    $this->add_site_option('my_test_option','my site test');

And we get this...

| 'get' option                  | Single site installation  | Site activated        | Network activated |
| ---                           | ---                       | ---                   | --- |
| `get_option()`                | 'my site test'            | 'my test'             | 'my test' |
| `get_network_option()`        | 'my site test'            | 'my site test'        | 'my site test' |
| `get_site_option()`           | 'my site test'            | 'my site test'        | 'my site test' |
| `$this->get_option()`         | 'my site test'            | 'my test'             | 'my test' |
| `$this->get_network_option()` | false                     | false                 | 'my site test' |
| `$this->get_site_option()`    | 'my site test'            | 'my site test'        | 'my site test' |

In short,

+   use `$this->add_option()` to add an option *only* used for an individual site.
+   use `$this->add_network_option()` to add an option *only* used when network activated on a multi-site installation.
+   use `$this->add_site_option()` to add an option used either for a single site or network-wide (all sites) when network activated.

#### Network Related Methods

| Method Name                                               | Description |
| -----------                                               | ----------- |
| `$this->is_network_enabled()`                             | Returns true if plugin is network-enabled |
| `$this->forEachNetworkSite( $callback, ...$arguments )`   | Execute $callback on each active site in a network |
| `$this->switch_to_blog( $new_blog_id )`                   | Switch the current WordPress blog |
| `$this->restore_current_blog()`                           | Restore the current blog, after calling switch_to_blog() |

\* *use `$this->is_network_enabled()` to determine if the plugin is network activated. Extensions may use `$this->is_network_enabled()` to determine if the extension is enabled at the network level or `$this->plugin->is_network_enabled()` to determine if the plugin is network activated.*

*Using `$this->switch_to_blog()` and `$this->restore_current_blog()` over the corresponding WordPress functions ensures that options are correctly saved and loaded for the switched-from/to blogs.*

### FAQ

#### Is {eac}Doojigger stable and reliable?

Since version 2, {eac}Doojigger has been meticulously updated to provide not only new features and efficiencies, but many other improvements, including stability and reliability. The code base of {eac}Doojigger has been in proprietary use (and in development) over several years and on several websites. However, there is a nearly infinte number of website configurations and uses that can't possibly be tested. If you run into any issues, problems, bugs or simply change requests, I'd be more than happy to address them and to work with you.
